# AgentOps & Token Economics Observatory

Production-grade backend platform for collecting, modeling, and analyzing AI application telemetry to optimize token consumption, inference cost, latency, routing decisions, and agent execution across enterprise-scale LLM systems.

## Overview

Large-scale AI applications introduce a new operational discipline beyond traditional observability. Every prompt, tool invocation, retrieval operation, and model selection carries measurable cost, latency, and quality tradeoffs.

This project builds an end-to-end AgentOps platform that transforms raw execution events into actionable operational intelligence, enabling engineering teams to continuously optimize AI workflows through data-driven analysis.

Rather than focusing on model development, the platform emphasizes the engineering systems surrounding production AI deployments.

## Engineering Objectives

- Collect structured execution telemetry from AI applications
- Model agent execution as event streams
- Quantify token consumption and financial cost
- Analyze prompt caching effectiveness
- Measure context deduplication savings
- Evaluate model routing policies
- Attribute costs across users, services, workflows, and business units
- Surface optimization opportunities through backend analytics APIs

---

## Example Questions the Platform Answers

- Which agents generate the highest token costs?
- Which workflows benefit most from prompt caching?
- How much money did context deduplication save this week?
- Which prompts exhibit the lowest cache hit rates?
- Which models deliver the best quality-to-cost ratio?
- Which retrieval pipelines introduce unnecessary latency?
- What is the cost per completed business task?
- Which teams consume the largest percentage of enterprise inference spend?
- Which prompt revisions increased operational costs?
- Which AI workflows regress after deployment?
